## Course points

Students are collecting assessment points. They come from a continuous assessment in the semester time:
The assessment method of this course consists of: 

   * **laboratory exercises and homework** evaluated during the exercise time (up to 40 pts.), 
   * two tests (0-60 pts.). 

In addition to satisfying the above assessment requirements, every student must satisfy the attendance requirements. 
There is an **obligatory attendance of tutorials** and an optional attendance of the lecture. 
The Pass mark for this course will be set at at 51 pts. (for Robotics) or 60 pts. (for EMARO). 
Credits will be awarded to candidates who pass this course.

## Points will be cut for:

   * repetitive code fragments - instead use loops (e.g. for, while),
   * hardcoded values like vector lengths - instead use variables or function parameters,
   * bad code style - for every task create a Matlab function making all the computations, if necessary use more functions for doing internal computations,
   * lack of comments in code.
